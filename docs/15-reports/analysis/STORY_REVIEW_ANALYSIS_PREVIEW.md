## 🎯 What We're Analyzing

### 1. Cultural Protocol Safety Checks

**Detecting:**
- 🔴 **Sacred Knowledge** - Ceremonial, restricted, gender-specific content → Requires Elder review
- 🟠 **Traumatic Content** - Violence, abuse, death, removal, stolen → Trigger warning needed
- 🟡 **Sensitive Cultural** - Language, ceremony, Country, ancestors → Cultural sensitivity review
- 🟠 **Consent Issues** - Identifiable names, locations, family → Verify consent

**Why This Matters:**
- Protects sacred knowledge from inappropriate sharing
- Ensures trauma survivors aren't re-traumatized
- Maintains cultural protocols (OCAP principles)
- Prevents consent violations

### 2. Tone Alignment with Empathy Ledger Values

**Flagging Problematic Language:**

| Issue | Patterns Detected | Severity | What to Use Instead |
|-------|------------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Savior Complex** | "we empower", "we give voice", "we help" | High | "we support" or center storyteller as actor |
| **Deficit Framing** | "disadvantaged", "marginalized", "at-risk" | Medium | "resilient", "community-led", "Indigenous-controlled" |
| **Othering** | "them", "those people", "recipients" | Medium | "we/us", "storytellers", "community members" |
| **Extraction** | "collect data", "harvest knowledge" | High | "preserve", "honor", "steward", "safeguard" |
| **Romanticization** | "ancient wisdom", "mystical", "exotic" | Medium | Specific, grounded language |

**Why This Matters:**
- Maintains respectful, strength-based framing
- Avoids perpetuating colonial narratives
- Centers Indigenous voices (not external "helpers")
- Prevents extractive language

### 3. Narrative Arc Patterns

**Detecting Story Structures:**
- **Circular Return** - Common in Indigenous storytelling (disruption → wandering → renewal)
- **Linear Journey** - Western 3-act structure (departure → trials → return)
- **Braided Stories** - Multiple intertwined narratives
- **Witnessing** - Observational testimony (trauma/justice stories)
- **Teaching Story** - Knowledge transmission from Elders

**Why This Matters:**
- Respects diverse storytelling traditions (not just Western)
- Identifies cultural markers (connection to Country, relational language, Elder wisdom)
- Recognizes different purposes (teaching vs. testimony vs. healing)

## 🎯 Expected Findings (Predictions)

### High Confidence Predictions:

1. **Most transcripts will score "Excellent" or "Good" on tone** (80%+)
   - Why: Claude Sonnet 4.5 already analyzed these with cultural sensitivity
   - Why: Platform culture emphasizes respectful language

2. **Some transcripts will need Elder review** (5-10%)
   - Why: Stories naturally include cultural knowledge, ceremony, language
   - This is GOOD - shows authentic Indigenous storytelling

3. **Trauma content will be present** (20-30%)
   - Why: Many stories address Stolen Generations, justice system, family separation
   - Action needed: Add trigger warnings

4. **Circular Return arc will dominate** (40-50% of analyzed narratives)
   - Why: Indigenous storytelling traditions favor cyclical, relational structures
   - This validates cultural authenticity

5. **Few savior/extraction language issues** (< 5%)
   - Why: Platform was built with OCAP principles from the start
   - Any issues likely in older transcripts or automated summaries

### What Success Looks Like:

- **< 5% high-severity tone issues** → Strong cultural alignment ✅
- **> 80% excellent/good scores** → Platform values embedded ✅
- **Clear protocol flags** → Safety systems working ✅
- **Diverse narrative arcs** → Respecting multiple traditions ✅

### What Would Be Concerning:

- **> 10% high-severity tone issues** → Need editorial intervention ❌
- **No sacred knowledge flags** → Detection not working ❌
- **All linear journey arcs** → Imposing Western structures ❌
- **High extraction language** → Missing platform values ❌

## 📝 Sample Flagged Transcript Analysis

**Example 1: Sacred Knowledge Detected**

```
Transcript: "Teaching About Ceremony"
ID: abc-123

Cultural Protocol Flags:
  • sacred_knowledge: ["ceremonial", "sacred"] (CRITICAL)
    Action: HALT - Requires Elder review
    Severity: critical

Recommendation:
  🔴 STOP: Do not publish until Elder reviews
  → Contact: Elder advisory board
  → Review: Cultural appropriateness of sharing
  → Decision: Elder has final say on publication
```

**Example 2: Trauma Content + Good Tone**

```
Transcript: "Stolen Generations Story"
ID: def-456

Cultural Protocol Flags:
  • traumatic_content: ["stolen", "removal", "family"] (HIGH)
    Action: Trigger warning required
    Severity: high

Tone Check:
  Alignment Score: Excellent ✅
  Flags: None
  Notes: Strength-based framing, storyteller-centered

Recommendation:
  ⚠️  Add trigger warning before transcript
  ✅ Tone is excellent - no changes needed
  → Suggested warning: "This story discusses experiences of the Stolen Generations"
```

**Example 3: Savior Language Detected**

```
Transcript: "Organization Impact Report"
ID: ghi-789

Tone Check:
  Alignment Score: Needs Work ❌
  Flags:
    • savior_complex: ["we empower", "we give voice"] (HIGH)
      Suggestion: Center storyteller as actor, not recipient
    • deficit_framing: ["marginalized communities"] (MEDIUM)
      Suggestion: Use "Indigenous-led" or "community-controlled"

Cultural Protocol Flags: None

Recommendation:
  📝 Editorial review needed
  → Reframe: "Storytellers share their powerful narratives"
  → Not: "We give marginalized communities a voice"
  → Focus: Platform supports (doesn't empower)
```
