# Session Completion Reports

**Purpose**: Historical session completion summaries

**What This Is**: Reports documenting major development sessions, feature completions, and milestones achieved throughout the Empathy Ledger development process.

**Sacred Boundaries** (NEVER):
- ❌ Never delete these reports without archiving (they show development history)
- ❌ Never use outdated session reports as current guidance (check dates)

## Quick Navigation

- **Most Recent Sessions** - Sort by date to find latest work
- **Feature-Specific Sessions** - Look for session names matching feature

## Time Frame

Most reports from: October 2025 - January 2026

---

**Time Saved**: These reports help agents understand what was already completed, avoiding duplicate work.
