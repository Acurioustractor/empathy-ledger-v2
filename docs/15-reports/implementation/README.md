# Implementation Completion Reports

**Purpose**: Implementation summaries and completion confirmations

**What This Is**: Reports confirming successful implementation of features, integrations, upgrades, and system components.

**Sacred Boundaries** (NEVER):
- ❌ Never assume implementation is current (check dates and verify in codebase)
- ❌ Never use completion reports as implementation guides (see /docs/05-features/ instead)

## Quick Navigation

- **Week-Based Reports** - WEEK_*.md files tracking weekly progress
- **Feature Completions** - *_COMPLETE.md files for feature confirmations
- **Integration Reports** - *_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md for external integrations

## Categories

- Database implementations
- AI system upgrades
- Storyteller management features
- JusticeHub integration
- Claude AI integrations

**Time Saved**: Quickly verify what is already implemented before planning new work.
