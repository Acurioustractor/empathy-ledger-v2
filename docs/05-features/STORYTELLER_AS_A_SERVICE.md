## Impact Measurement

### What We Measure

| Metric | Description | ALMA Signal |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Theme Frequency | How often themes appear across stories | Evidence |
| Evidence Strength | Quality and depth of narrative evidence | Evidence |
| Lived Experience Ratio | Percentage of first-person accounts | Authority |
| Cultural Safety Score | Absence of harmful patterns | Harm Prevention |
| Capability Pathways | Forward-looking recommendations identified | Capability |
| Community Value | Benefit distribution tracking | Community Value |

### What We Don't Measure

- Individual storyteller "performance"
- Competitive rankings between storytellers
- Extractive metrics that commodify narratives
- Any metric that could harm storytellers

- 0.4-0.6: Building capacity - training in progress
- 0.7-0.9: Ready for handover - local capacity strong
- 1.0: Fully handed over - organization self-sufficient

### Handover Support
