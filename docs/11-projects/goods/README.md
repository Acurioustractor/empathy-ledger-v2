# GOODS Project Documentation

**Purpose**: Project-specific documentation for the GOODS (Goods Outcomes Outcomes Design System) project

**What This Is**: Setup guides, strategic plans, and issue documentation specific to the GOODS project integration with Empathy Ledger.

**Sacred Boundaries** (NEVER):
- ❌ Never apply GOODS-specific solutions to other projects without validation
- ❌ Never ignore known issues documented here

## Key Documents

- **GOODS_PROJECT_SETUP.md** - Project setup and configuration
- **GOODS_STRATEGIC_PATH_FORWARD.md** - Strategic direction
- **GOODS_AI_QUOTE_FABRICATION_ISSUE.md** - Known AI quote fabrication issue
- **GOODS_OUTCOMES_TRACKER_PROBLEM.md** - Outcomes tracker issues

---

**Time Saved**: Avoid rediscovering known issues and solutions.
