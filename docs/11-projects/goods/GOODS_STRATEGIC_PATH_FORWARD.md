# GOODS Project - Strategic Path Forward

**Project:** Goods. (Creating better white goods and beds for community)
**Communities:** Lockhart River and Palm Island
**Organization:** A Curious Tractor / Snow Foundation
**Date:** October 27, 2025

Based on stories and wisdom from 23 community members across diverse contexts and expertise areas.

---

## Purpose Statement

The GOODS project addresses a fundamental community need - access to safe, functional white goods (refrigerators, washing machines) and beds - through a community-led co-creation model. Walking alongside Lockhart River and Palm Island communities, this initiative recognizes that basic household infrastructure is foundational to health, dignity, and family wellbeing.

---

## Continuation Strategies
*How to sustainably continue this project with community leadership*

### 1. Build Local Capacity Through "Goods Champions"

Drawing from the successful RHD Champions model demonstrated in related Snow Foundation work, establish **Community Goods Champions** who:

- Lead goods assessments in their own communities
- Train others in basic appliance maintenance
- Coordinate collection and distribution logistics
- Bridge cultural contexts between communities and service providers
- Share stories of impact to maintain momentum

**Key Principle:** *"We want the community to help lead. We want to walk with them."* (Project Purpose)

This approach honors community leadership while building long-term sustainability independent of external coordination.

### 2. Create a Community-Led Goods Cooperative

Transition from project-based delivery to a **community-owned cooperative model**:

- Community members govern decision-making
- Local employment for goods repair, refurbishment, distribution
- Revenue generation through appliance recycling programs
- Partnerships with retailers for bulk community purchasing
- Training programs run BY community FOR community

**Inspiration from Storytellers:**
- **Javier Aparicio Grau's** 16-year commitment to "carefully guiding youth from morning routines to enriching educational experiences" shows the power of consistent, patient mentorship
- **Chelsea Rolfe's** approach to "collection of shells, coral, and native wildlife as symbols of continuity and care" demonstrates how practical work can honor cultural legacy

### 3. Integrate with Existing Community Development Initiatives

Link GOODS to broader community health and development programs:

- **Health Equity:** Functional refrigeration = food storage = nutrition = health outcomes
- **Education Support:** Washing machines = clean school uniforms = attendance = learning
- **Employment Pathways:** Goods repair training = vocational skills = local jobs
- **Cultural Continuity:** Safe homes = space for cultural practice = elder teaching transmission

**Evidence from Storytellers:**
- **Kate Bjur's** research on "identity and belonging" shows how "timely support and genuine connection redefine futures"
- **Jesús Teruel's** work achieving 20-25% recidivism through "environments that emphasize growth over confinement" proves holistic support transforms outcomes

### 4. Establish Cross-Community Learning Networks

Connect Lockhart River and Palm Island with other communities facing similar challenges:

- Quarterly goods exchange/sharing events
- Online platforms for requesting/offering appliances
- Inter-community repair workshops
- Story-sharing to document impact and learnings
- Expansion to additional communities using proven model

**Cultural Safety Principle:** Ensure each community maintains sovereignty over their participation and adapts the model to their unique context.

## System Change Opportunities
*Where this project could influence broader systems*

### 1. Redefine "Essential Services" to Include Household Goods

**Current System Failure:**
Basic utilities (water, power) are considered "essential" but functional refrigeration/washing/sleeping infrastructure is not - despite being equally fundamental to health and dignity.

**GOODS Opportunity:**
Advocate for policy change recognizing:
- **Refrigeration = Essential Service** (food safety, medicine storage, nutrition access)
- **Washing Machines = Essential Service** (hygiene, health, school participation)
- **Beds = Essential Service** (sleep quality, child development, workplace productivity)

**Pathway:**
- Document health outcomes data: households with GOODS vs without
- Partner with AIHW and health researchers
- Present findings to State/Federal policymakers
- Advocate for household goods inclusion in NDIS, Centrelink support, public housing standards

### 2. Shift Retail Industry Practices for Remote Communities

**Current System Failure:**
Major retailers don't deliver to remote Indigenous communities, forcing reliance on expensive local stores with limited stock, or impossible 100+ km trips to purchase goods.

**GOODS Opportunity:**
Demonstrate a new business model:
- **Community Bulk Orders** (25 fridges at once = delivery viable)
- **Cooperative Purchasing Power** (community pooled funds = volume discounts)
- **Return Logistics** (pick up broken goods when delivering new = circular economy)

**Pathway:**
- Build successful pilot with one major retailer
- Showcase cost savings + community satisfaction + environmental benefits
- Scale model to national retailers
- Influence ACCC (Australian Competition & Consumer Commission) guidelines on remote area pricing

### 3. Transform Indigenous Housing Policy

**Current System Failure:**
Housing programs build/renovate structures but don't ensure functional household infrastructure. Families move into "new" homes without fridges, washing machines, beds.

**GOODS Opportunity:**
Integrate goods provision into housing policy:
- **Standard:** Every home receives full household goods package before occupancy
- **Maintenance:** Regular goods assessment and replacement built into housing management
- **Employment:** Local community members trained and employed as goods coordinators

**Pathway:**
- Partner with Indigenous Housing Authorities
- Document current gaps and impact on families
- Propose integrated housing + goods model
- Trial in one community, scale to national policy

### 4. Establish Community-Controlled Social Enterprise Model

**Current System Failure:**
Dependency on external charities and government programs that come and go, creating uncertainty and lack of community ownership.

**GOODS Opportunity:**
Create a **replicable social enterprise blueprint:**
- Community owns and governs the goods program
- Revenue generation through repair services, recycling, bulk purchasing margins
- Employment of community members
- Financial sustainability beyond grant cycles
- Cultural governance embedded in operating model

**Pathway:**
- Document GOODS model in detail (operations manual)
- Support 2-3 additional communities to adapt the model
- Create national network of Goods Cooperatives
- Influence social enterprise policy and funding programs

### 5. Challenge "Deficit Narrative" About Remote Communities

**Current System Failure:**
Remote Indigenous communities are portrayed as "needy recipients" rather than capable leaders and innovators.

**GOODS Opportunity:**
Flip the narrative through storytelling:
- **23 Community Voices** documented (diverse expertise, leadership, cultural wisdom)
- Stories showcasing community co-creation, not charity
- Evidence of community-led solutions outperforming top-down programs
- Cultural strengths as foundation for practical innovation

**Examples from Storytellers:**
- **Chelsea Rolfe:** "Justice as holistic concept encompassing sovereignty, health, and housing"
- **Jesús Teruel:** Communities achieving 75-80% success through "personalized care and dignity"
- **Kate Bjur:** "Trust, timely support, and genuine connection redefine futures"

**Pathway:**
- Create powerful multimedia stories from GOODS participants
- Present at national conferences (housing, health, Indigenous affairs)
- Influence media narratives
- Partner with universities to publish research

## Why GOODS Matters: The Bigger Picture

The GOODS project is not about appliances. It's about:

- **Health Equity** - Functional fridges = food security = nutrition = healthy families
- **Educational Access** - Washing machines = clean uniforms = school attendance = learning
- **Economic Opportunity** - Repair skills = employment = financial stability = self-determination
- **Cultural Integrity** - Safe homes = space for cultural practice = elder teaching = cultural continuity
- **Dignity & Belonging** - Households that function = pride = identity = hope
- **System Transformation** - Community-led model = proof alternative to top-down charity = policy influence

**As Kate Bjur's research shows:** "Trust, timely support, and genuine connection redefine futures."

**As Chelsea Rolfe demonstrates:** Justice is holistic - sovereignty, health, and housing are inseparable.

**As Jesús Teruel proves:** When people are treated with dignity and given personalized support, they thrive (75-80% success rate).

**As Enrique López insists:** Communities deserve to be seen and supported, not controlled and managed.

---

## Call to Action

This is not a plan to be implemented ON community.
This is a plan to be refined BY community, led by community, owned by community.

**Next Steps:**
1. Share this document with Elders and community leaders
2. Gather feedback: What resonates? What's missing? What needs changing?
3. Co-create the implementation plan together
4. Walk alongside the community every step of the journey

**As the GOODS project purpose states:**
*"We want to walk with them."*

Not in front. Not behind. Alongside.
