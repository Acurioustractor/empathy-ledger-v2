### **Story Previews** (150-word summaries)

**1. "From Muswellbrook to Global Platform: A Journey in Community-Centered Innovation"**
_Primary Story Preview_

Growing up in Muswellbrook, NSW, taught me that authentic relationships matter more than credentials. This small-town foundation led me through youth work with Aboriginal communities, international teaching experiences, and roles with Orange Sky and AIME—each teaching me how technology could amplify community wisdom rather than extract from it.

Co-founding A Curious Tractor with Nicholas Marchesi became a laboratory for testing community-centered principles. Our Youth Justice project proved that the most powerful professional stories come from frontline community workers whose expertise is rarely captured in traditional networking formats.

Now, building Empathy Ledger as the storytelling-centered alternative to LinkedIn, I'm demonstrating that professional networking can be built on empathy rather than extraction, honoring stories over resumes, and creating platforms that serve communities rather than exploit them...

**2. "The Origin of A Curious Tractor: Building Technology That Cultivates Community"**
_Supporting Story Preview_

The name "A Curious Tractor" confuses people sometimes, but it perfectly captures our philosophy: technology should cultivate community growth rather than extract community value. A tractor doesn't harvest—it prepares soil for growth, working with natural systems rather than against them.

The founding moment came during conversations with Nicholas about building something different from the ground up. We were both frustrated with organizations that talked about community empowerment but built extractive systems. Our Youth Justice project became proof that community-led development isn't just more ethical—it's more effective...

**3. "Aboriginal Communities and Global Platforms: Cultural Protocols in Technology Design"**
_Supporting Story Preview_

The most important lesson about building platforms didn't come from computer science—it came from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who taught me that authentic relationship-building has protocols refined over thousands of years. Technology designed without community protocols inevitably becomes extractive.

Working with Aboriginal communities taught me about data sovereignty, reciprocal relationships, and cultural competency that now shapes every aspect of Empathy Ledger's development. These aren't just ethical additions—they're foundational principles for building technology that serves rather than exploits...
