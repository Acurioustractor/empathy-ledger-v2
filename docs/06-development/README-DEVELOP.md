# Development Branch

This is the main development branch where all feature branches merge.

## Branch Strategy:
- main: Production-ready code
- develop: Integration branch for development
- feature/cultural-*: Cultural feature branches
- feature/technical-*: Technical feature branches

Never commit directly to main or develop. Always use pull requests.
