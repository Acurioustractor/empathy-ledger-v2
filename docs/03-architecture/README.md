# Technical Architecture Documentation

**Purpose**: System architecture, technical design, and structural documentation

**What This Is**: High-level technical architecture documents explaining how Empathy Ledger is structured, page architecture, and system design patterns.

**Sacred Boundaries** (NEVER):
- ❌ Never add new pages without reviewing page architecture
- ❌ Never change multi-tenant architecture without careful RLS policy review

## Key Documents

- **EMPATHY_LEDGER_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Overall technical architecture
- **COMPLETE_PAGE_ARCHITECTURE_WITH_MEDIA.md** - Complete page structure and routing

---

**Time Saved**: Understand system design before adding new components.
