## Key Principles Throughout Process

### 1. Community Voice Leads Everything

**As Dianne Stokes said: "They need to hear from the ground."**

- Storyteller quotes open every application answer
- Community priorities define research questions
- Community benefit drives decision-making
- Community veto power over all outputs

### 2. Cultural Protocols Are Non-Negotiable

- Never violate cultural protocols to meet deadline
- Follow community-specific consultation processes
- Respect sacred and restricted knowledge
- Get cultural advisor approval

### 3. Relationship > Funding

- If application would harm community relationship, don't submit
- Trust takes years to build, seconds to destroy
- This is one funding opportunity - community partnership is ongoing
- "No" from community is community self-determination in action

### 4. Evidence-Based Claims Only

- Every claim tested against storyteller evidence
- No theoretical statements without community backing
- Alfred's bed safety, Daniel's "going without," Dianne's "hear from the ground" - these are the proof
- Data and quotes support all assertions

### 5. OCAP® Principles Throughout

- **Ownership:** Communities own their data and narratives
- **Control:** Communities control how information is shared
- **Access:** Communities define who can access what
- **Possession:** Communities can export data, withdraw consent anytime

   - Trust maintained regardless of application outcome
   - Community sees benefit in conversation itself

2. **Cultural Protocols Respected**

   - No violations of sacred knowledge

3. **Genuine Community Voice Integrated**
   - Application reflects community priorities
   - Community-defined research questions included
   - Storyteller words used respectfully

4. **High-Quality Application Submitted**

   - Systems change potential clear

5. **Path Forward Regardless of Outcome**
   - If successful: Clear plan for fellowship implementation

## What Makes This Application Different

Most fellowship applications:
- Start with problems and theories
- Use community examples to support researcher agenda
- Promise community benefit after research complete

**This application:**
- Starts with 22 community voices already proving solutions work
- Uses researcher capacity to amplify community agenda
- Delivers community benefit throughout research process

**Alfred doesn't need research to tell him bed safety matters.**
**Daniel doesn't need theories about dignity.**
**Dianne doesn't need consultation frameworks—she needs systems that "hear from the ground."**

This fellowship will document, validate, and scale what communities are already teaching us:

**First Nations self-determination isn't a research question. It's a lived practice requiring systems that listen.**
