# Empathy Ledger Brand Guide

## The Logo: Embrace

Our logo is called **"Embrace"** — two open circles reaching toward each other, their openings facing inward in a gesture of mutual holding.

### Visual Description

The mark consists of two semicircular arcs:
- The **left arc** opens to the right
- The **right arc** opens to the left
- They face each other, creating a space of connection in the center

### Connection to Our Mission

**Empathy Ledger exists to preserve and amplify the stories of communities whose voices have been historically marginalized.** The Embrace logo embodies this mission in every curve:

#### Two Individuals Coming Together
Each arc represents a person — a storyteller and a listener, a community member and the world, an Elder and the next generation. Neither is complete on its own. The power comes from the meeting.

#### Open, Not Closed
Unlike closed circles (which suggest self-containment), our arcs are deliberately **open**. This represents:
- **Vulnerability** — The courage it takes to share one's story
- **Receptivity** — The openness required to truly listen
- **Invitation** — Anyone can enter this space of connection

#### The Space Between
The most important part of the logo is what's *not* there — the space where the arcs meet. This represents:
- **The interview** — Where stories are shared
- **The transcript** — Where words become record
- **The ledger** — Where human experience is preserved
- **Empathy itself** — Which exists only in the space between people

#### Mutual Holding
The arcs don't just face each other — they *hold* each other. This reflects our core belief that:
- Stories deserve to be held with care
- Communities should have agency over their narratives
- The relationship between storyteller and platform must be reciprocal

### Earth Tone Gradient

The gradient flows through three colors that connect to land, community, and growth:

| Color | Hex | Meaning |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **Ochre** | `#96643a` | Earth, ancestry, the land from which stories emerge |
| **Terracotta** | `#b84a32` | Warmth, humanity, the heart of storytelling |
| **Sage** | `#5c6d51` | Growth, healing, the future we're building |

This palette was chosen to feel:
- **Warm** — Inviting and human, not cold or corporate
- **Grounded** — Connected to earth and place
- **Timeless** — These colors have been used for millennia

### Typography

**Wordmark:** Georgia (serif)
- Classic, readable, dignified
- Suggests permanence and trust
- "Ledger" should feel like a record that matters

**Body text:** System sans-serif
- Clean, accessible, modern
- Doesn't compete with the stories

### Logo Variations

| Variant | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **Default (gradient)** | Primary brand use, digital |
| **Mono (charcoal)** | Documents, formal print, single-color |
| **Light** | On dark backgrounds |

### The Name: Empathy Ledger

**Empathy** — Our north star. We believe that hearing someone's story creates understanding. Understanding creates connection. Connection creates change.

**Ledger** — A deliberate choice:
- A ledger is a **record** — We preserve what matters
- A ledger is **accountable** — Every entry is tracked and attributed
- A ledger has **value** — These stories are assets, not just content
- A ledger is **permanent** — What we record, we keep

Together: **A record of human understanding.**

## The Embrace in Practice

When you see the Embrace logo, remember:

> Two people, facing each other, open and ready to connect. The space between them is where empathy lives — and that's exactly what we're here to record.
