# Community Consultation Guide - PRF Fellowship Application
## Respectful Conversation Framework for GOODS Storyteller Engagement

**Purpose:** Guide genuine, respectful conversations with 22 GOODS storytellers about PRF Fellowship application
**Guiding Principle:** Listen more than you talk. Respect "no" as much as "yes."
**Cultural Protocol:** Follow community-specific consultation processes

---

## Before Any Consultation

### Preparation Checklist:

- [ ] Review each storyteller's contributions from GOODS project
- [ ] Understand their community context (Palm Island, Yarrabah, Tennant Creek, etc.)
- [ ] Identify any cultural protocols specific to their community
- [ ] Prepare to offer compensation for their time (consultation fees)
- [ ] Have community-approved materials ready (plain English, no jargon)
- [ ] Schedule at their convenience, in their preferred format (in-person, phone, video)
- [ ] Allow adequate time - don't rush community conversations

### Cultural Respect Principles:

1. **Community Time ≠ Your Time**
   - Don't schedule back-to-back consultations
   - Allow for "yarn time" - conversations may take longer than expected
   - Respect if someone needs to reschedule or take breaks

2. **Community Knowledge = Valuable Expertise**
   - Offer appropriate compensation for time and knowledge
   - This isn't "free consultation" - it's expert advisory
   - Budget has allocated funds for community compensation

3. **Community Decision-Making ≠ Individual Decisions**
   - Some storytellers may need to consult family, elders, community leadership
   - Respect collective decision-making processes
   - Don't pressure for immediate answers

4. **Cultural Protocols Matter**
   - Some knowledge may be gender-restricted
   - Some topics may require elder present
   - Some communities may have specific consultation processes
   - Ask about protocols, don't assume

## Consultation Framework: The Four Core GOODS Storytellers

**Priority Consultations:**
1. Carmelita & Colette (Palm Island)
2. Ivy (Island community)
3. Alfred Johnson (Townsville)
4. Daniel Patrick Noble (Yarrabah)

### Opening the Conversation

**Plain English Introduction:**

> "Thank you for taking time to talk with me today. I wanted to discuss an opportunity that came up related to the GOODS project and the stories you've shared on the Empathy Ledger platform.
>
> There's a fellowship - basically a grant - from the Paul Ramsay Foundation worth up to $250,000 over 18 months. It's specifically for work that helps First Nations communities lead their own futures.
>
> I'm thinking about applying to research and scale the GOODS community-owned manufacturing model - the beds, washing machines, fridges that communities design and make themselves.
>
> But before I even consider applying, I need to talk with you and the other storytellers, because:
> 1. I want to use your words from your stories in the application
> 2. If I get the fellowship, you would be co-researchers, not just 'study subjects'
> 3. This only makes sense if it benefits your community
>
> So I'm here to listen, get your permission, and understand what you think about this opportunity."

**Let them respond. Really listen.**

### Core Questions (Adapted to Conversation Flow)

#### Question Set 1: Permission & Representation

**What to Ask:**

1. **Quote Usage Permission:**
   > "In your story on the platform, you said [specific quote]. For example, Alfred, you said 'you feel more safe when you sleep in a bed.' Would it be okay if I used your words like this in the fellowship application?"

2. **Identification Preferences:**
   > "How would you like to be identified in the application?
   > - Full name?
   > - First name only?
   > - Community name?
   > - What feels right to you?"

3. **Quote Boundaries:**
   > "Are there any parts of your story that should NOT be shared publicly or in this application? I want to make sure I respect what's private and what's okay to share."

**What to Listen For:**

- Hesitation or discomfort (respect it - don't push)
- Specific requests about how to use quotes
- Cultural concerns about certain topics
- Family or community consultation needed

**Document:**

- [ ] Written consent obtained (email, text, or signed form - whatever community prefers)

---

#### Question Set 2: Co-Researcher Role

**What to Ask:**

1. **Participation Willingness:**
   > "If this fellowship is successful, the research would be done WITH you, not just ABOUT you. You'd be what's called a 'co-researcher' - meaning you'd have decision-making power over:
   > - What questions we research
   > - How we do the research
   > - What gets published
   > - Who sees the results
   >
   > Would you be interested in participating as a co-researcher? This would be paid work - we have budget for storyteller compensation."

2. **Time Commitment Reality Check:**
   > "Being honest about time - this would involve:
   > - Interviews and conversations (maybe 3-4 hours over 18 months)
   > - Reviewing research findings before publication
   > - Possibly participating in workshops or presentations
   > - Having veto power over anything you're not comfortable with
   >
   > Does this sound manageable with your other commitments?"

3. **Compensation Discussion:**
   > "What would fair compensation look like for your time and knowledge? The budget has funds allocated for community compensation - I want to make sure it respects your expertise."

**What to Listen For:**

- Genuine interest vs. polite "yes"
- Time constraints or competing commitments
- Concerns about research process
- Questions about decision-making authority

**Document:**

- [ ] Co-researcher interest level (enthusiastic, willing, hesitant, not interested)

#### Question Set 3: Research Direction

**What to Ask:**

1. **Community-Defined Questions:**
   > "The fellowship is about researching how community-owned manufacturing - like GOODS - enables First Nations self-determination. But I don't want to decide the research questions alone.
   >
   > What questions about GOODS do YOU most want answered?
   > - Things you're curious about?
   > - Things you think would help other communities?
   > - Things policy makers need to understand?"

2. **Success Definition:**
   > "If this fellowship happened and was successful from your perspective, what would that look like?
   > - What would be different in your community?
   > - What would you have learned?
   > - What would change more broadly?"

3. **"Another Research Project" Concerns:**
   > "I know communities are often 'researched to death' with nothing changing. What concerns do you have about this becoming another research project where outsiders benefit but communities don't?"

**What to Listen For:**

- Specific community priorities emerging
- Previous negative research experiences
- Skepticism about research value
- Ideas you hadn't considered

**Document:**

   > "How can this research directly benefit your community?
   > - More funding for GOODS manufacturing?
   > - Skills development?
   > - Employment opportunities?
   > - Policy changes that help your community?
   > - Something else entirely?"

2. **Worth Assessment:**
   > "This will take your time and energy. What would make it worth it for you?
   > - What's the minimum you'd need to see to feel good about participating?
   > - What outcomes would make you say 'Yes, this was valuable'?"

3. **Ownership Guarantees:**
   > "What guarantees do you need about community ownership of the research findings?
   > - Who owns the data?
   > - Who controls publications?
   > - Can you use findings for your own purposes?
   > - What if community wants to withdraw from research?"

**What to Listen For:**

- Concrete benefit expectations
- Deal-breakers or non-negotiables
- Ownership and control priorities
- Previous experiences with research exploitation

**Document:**

- [ ] Expected community benefits
- [ ] Minimum value threshold
- [ ] Ownership requirements
- [ ] Non-negotiable conditions

#### Question Set 5: Cultural Protocols

**What to Ask:**

1. **Cultural Considerations:**
   > "Are there any cultural considerations I need to be aware of in the application or research?
   > - Topics that need elder approval?
   > - Knowledge that's gender-specific?
   > - Protocols about how information is shared?
   > - Anything I might not know to ask about?"

2. **Audience Restrictions:**
   > "Should certain knowledge be shared only with specific audiences?
   > - Some information only for First Nations people?
   > - Some only for your specific community?
   > - Some requiring cultural context before sharing?"

3. **Cultural Advisor Review:**

### Closing the Conversation

**Thank Them:**

> "Thank you so much for your time and wisdom. Your input will directly shape whether I apply and, if I do, what the application says and how the research would be done.
>
> I'll be talking with [other storytellers/cultural advisors/community leadership] over the next [timeframe], and then I'll come back to you with:
> - Whether I'm moving forward with the application
> - How I plan to use your words (with examples you can approve)
> - What the next steps would be if the fellowship is successful
>
> You can change your mind at any time - if you say yes now and later feel uncomfortable, that's completely okay.
>
> Do you have any questions for me?"

**Arrange Compensation:**

> "I want to arrange payment for your time today. What's the best way to get consultation fees to you? [Discuss payment method, amount, timeline]"

**Next Contact:**

> "When would be a good time to follow up? I'll be working on the application over the next [timeframe] and may need to check back with you about [specific items]. What's the best way to reach you if I have questions?"

## Consultation Framework: Broader GOODS Storyteller Group

**For the 18 additional storytellers beyond the four core GOODS participants:**

### Collective vs. Individual Consultation

**Option 1: Collective Workshop**
- Invite all 18 storytellers to group consultation session
- Present fellowship opportunity collectively
- Discuss as group with individual follow-up for specific permissions
- Advantages: Builds on collective knowledge, efficient, community-building
- Disadvantages: May miss individual perspectives, some may be uncomfortable speaking in group

**Option 2: Community Representative Model**
- Work with community leadership to identify representative storyteller group (5-7 people)
- Representatives consult with broader storyteller community
- Follow community decision-making processes
- Advantages: Respects community governance, culturally appropriate
- Disadvantages: Requires strong community structures, takes more time

**Option 3: Individual Consultations**
- One-on-one conversations with all 18 storytellers
- Most thorough but most time-intensive
- Advantages: Every voice heard individually, most respectful of individual agency
- Disadvantages: Time-intensive, may be culturally inappropriate in some contexts

**Recommendation:** Consult with community leadership about culturally appropriate consultation model for their specific community.

---

### Modified Question Framework for Broader Group

If individual or small group consultations:

**Shortened Consultation Focus:**

1. **Permission for Quote Usage:**
   - Show them their specific quotes being considered
   - Get explicit consent for public use in application
   - Document identification preferences

2. **Awareness of Fellowship:**
   - Brief explanation of opportunity
   - How it connects to their GOODS participation
   - Potential for involvement as co-researchers

3. **Community Benefit Check:**
   - Does this align with community priorities?
   - Any concerns about how GOODS is being represented?
   - Interest in ongoing participation?

**Time Estimate:** 15-30 minutes per storyteller (vs. 60-90 minutes for core four)

## Difficult Conversation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Storyteller Says "No"

**Response:**

> "Thank you for being honest. I really appreciate you taking the time to think about it. Can I ask - is this a 'no' because:
> - The timing isn't right?
> - You have concerns about how information would be used?
> - You're not comfortable with research in general?
> - Something else?
>
> Understanding why helps me know if there's something I should change about the approach, or if this just isn't the right opportunity."

**Then:**

- **Respect the "no" completely**
- Don't try to convince them
- Thank them for their time and pay consultation fee
- Ask if they're comfortable with you staying in touch generally (not about this application)
- Document the "no" and ensure their words are not used in application

**If Multiple Storytellers Say "No":**

**STOP THE APPLICATION PROCESS.**

This is community feedback that the approach is wrong, trust isn't there, or timing is bad. Respect it.

---

### Scenario 2: Storyteller Says "I Need to Think About It"

**Response:**

> "Of course, take all the time you need. When would be a good time for me to follow up? Or would you prefer to reach out to me when you've had time to think?
>
> Is there any information I can provide that would help you make the decision?
> - More details about the fellowship?
> - Examples of how your words would be used?
> - Speaking with other storytellers who've decided?
> - Talking with cultural advisors?"

**Then:**

- Provide requested information
- Set follow-up timeline (their preference)
- Don't pressure
- Pay consultation fee for time already spent
- Be prepared for "no" at follow-up

---

### Scenario 3: Storyteller Has Concerns About Previous Research

**Response:**

> "I hear you, and I'm really sorry if you've had bad experiences with researchers before. That's exactly what I'm trying NOT to do, but I understand why you might be skeptical.
>
> Can you tell me more about what went wrong before? What should I be doing differently?"

**Listen carefully. Then:**

> "Based on what you've said, here's what I'm committing to do differently:
> [Specific commitments based on their concerns]
>
> Would those commitments address your concerns? What else would I need to do for you to feel comfortable?"

**Key Commitments to Offer:**

- Community veto power over all publications
- Data ownership by communities, not researcher
- Results shared back before any external publication
- Compensation for community time and knowledge
- This conversation doesn't bind you - you can withdraw at any time

---

### Scenario 4: Cultural Protocols Require Different Process

**Response:**

> "Thank you for letting me know. I want to make sure I follow the right process for your community.
>
> Can you help me understand:
> - Who should I be talking to?
> - What's the appropriate process?
> - How long does that process usually take?
> - Is there anything I should prepare or know before approaching [elder/leadership/cultural authority]?"

**Then:**

- Follow the process they describe, even if time-consuming
- Don't try to shortcut cultural protocols
- If timeline doesn't work (November 19 deadline), consider:
  - Postponing application to next funding cycle
  - Adjusting scope to exclude communities where protocols can't be met in time
  - Getting preliminary approval with full protocol completion if fellowship successful

**Never violate cultural protocols to meet application deadline.**

## Cultural Sensitivity Reminders

### Throughout All Consultations:

- ✅ Respect silence and thinking time
- ✅ Follow community time, not clock time
- ✅ Pay for community expertise
- ✅ Respect "no" as much as "yes"
- ✅ Follow cultural protocols even if time-consuming
- ✅ Ask "What should I know that I haven't asked about?"
- ✅ Keep relationship as priority over application outcome

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Rush conversations to meet your deadline
- ❌ Use jargon or academic language
- ❌ Assume you know what's best for community
- ❌ Treat storytellers as data sources rather than experts
- ❌ Make promises you can't keep
- ❌ Violate cultural protocols for convenience
- ❌ Pressure for answers
- ❌ Extract knowledge without fair compensation

---

## Success Criteria for Community Consultations

**This consultation phase is successful if:**

1. **Relationships Maintained or Strengthened:**
   - No storyteller feels used or disrespected
   - Trust is maintained regardless of application outcome
   - Community sees benefit in conversation itself

2. **Genuine Community Voice Integrated:**
   - Application reflects community priorities, not just researcher agenda
   - Community-defined research questions included
   - Storyteller words used respectfully and accurately

3. **Cultural Protocols Respected:**
   - All consultations followed appropriate cultural processes
   - Cultural advisors approved approach
   - No violations of sacred or restricted knowledge

4. **Informed Consent Achieved:**
   - All storytellers understand fellowship and research implications
   - Permissions are genuine, not coerced
   - Everyone knows they can withdraw consent at any time

5. **Community Benefit Clear:**
   - All participants understand how this could benefit their community
   - Expectations are realistic and achievable
   - Ownership and control guaranteed

**If these criteria aren't met, do not submit the application.**

Relationship with communities > Fellowship funding

## Final Reminder

**Dianne Stokes said: "They need to hear from the ground."**

These consultations ARE "hearing from the ground."

If you're doing most of the talking, you're doing it wrong.

If storytellers are telling you things you don't want to hear, THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT FEEDBACK.

If consultations reveal the application shouldn't proceed, THAT'S A SUCCESS - community voice prevented inappropriate research.

**The goal isn't to get storytellers to say "yes."**

**The goal is to genuinely understand community perspective and respect community decision-making.**

If that leads to "yes," wonderful.

If that leads to "no" or "not now" or "only if...," also wonderful - community self-determination in action.
