## Final Reminders

### What This Application Is:

- ✅ Amplifying 22 storytellers' voices to national policy level
- ✅ Validating community-owned manufacturing model
- ✅ Creating evidence base for systems change
- ✅ Respecting and centering community knowledge
- ✅ Building long-term community partnerships

### What This Application Is NOT:

- ❌ Extractive research that benefits researcher over community
- ❌ Theoretical exploration disconnected from community needs
- ❌ Individual career advancement at community expense
- ❌ One-time project that ends when funding ends
- ❌ Undermining community ownership or self-determination

### The North Star:

**Dianne Stokes said: "They need to hear from the ground."**

If every decision in this pre-submission phase serves that principle—ensuring ground-level community voices reach the people who can create systems change—then the application succeeds regardless of funding outcome.

The 22 storytellers have spoken. This fellowship application ensures Australia listens.
