          "title": "Aunty Vicky Wade - Community Story",
          "transcript_content": "Aunty Vicky Wade\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nHi, my name's Auntie Vicki. That's V-I-C-K-I and auntie A-N-U-T-Y. And my surname Wade, WADE. \n\nI've always been interested in health and in particular heart health. from an early age, I had relatives, Nan had a pacemaker, so I was always interested in health.\n\nthrough my matriarchal lineage, I come from healers, so women in my family are healers. my nan was a healer on the mission. She looked after, children. She birthed mums at the birthing tree, and then mum became an enrolled nurse, and then I became a nurse and my daughter's a doctor. that matriarchal lineage of healers, we've got a strong desire to look after our mob and I'm just fascinated with the heart.\n\nSo I went into heart health, gee, 40 years or more ago.\n\nI think it's important that when we go out on community, particularly when it's not my land, that I go softly. I always tread softly because I think the footprints that we leave in community is so important and that [00:01:00] will, give us an invitation back. So if we go in their loud way, if we walk real quickly and not look at and take in what's going around us, this is what our old people did, and our old people told us.\n\nWhen we go into community, particularly my old Nan Lily, she said, you go in there with your eyes and you go in there with your ears. And you keep that mouth shut. I observe, I never go onto country unless I am welcomed by traditional owners. So that's really, really important for me and an important message for the trek that we have to go, quietly.\n\nAnd their cultural protocols are really important because you could be walking on a sacred site or you go in men's business area and you don't know. So it's really important for us to ground ourselves on the country we are in.\n\nDr. Bo came to me and Dr. Gavin. So Dr. Gavin and Dr. Beau, that's their job and they thought, oh gee, there's a lot of young kids out here that we pick up with rheumatic heart disease. So they came to me and they said, what [00:02:00] would that look like in a cultural sense?\n\nAnd I said, yeah, that's fantastic. our mothers and our aunties and our grandmothers we're sick of our little kids. Being sick. So we would be welcomed on country by that strong women and some communities are, patriarchal. So the men are strong in that community. So I did a little bit of asking around and yeah, it was very welcome for us to go out on country to do the trek.\n\nSo it was really Dr. Bow and Dr. Gavin came to me.\n\nThe Trek is not, we're on camels. The trek is not, we are walking the trek is that, it's a trek because we originally wanted to go right across Australia, but we understand that it takes a lot of preparation to get into communities, to get permission from the, education department to visit schools and the clinics.\n\nSo we have to do a lot of consultation before we go into the trek. So how I'd explain it is the Trek is a group of passionate, culturally safe people that go [00:03:00] into communities. We scan hearts, we check skin and raise awareness. So what we are really wanting to do is pick up kids with rheumatic heart disease early.\n\nIf we pick them up early, we can prevent them from having open heart surgery. Sonographers, cultural guides are really important, so we always have to have people with the cultural knowledge. \n\nWhat I think is the litmus test is that communities are banging on our door. They've heard about it and they want us to come out and screen their kids. And we have a few communities now. We have, about four communities that wanting us to visit, but it takes a while. So we have to, plan it, so we do it proper way.\n\nWe're not rushing in and rushing out and living a big mess. Like a lot of people that go into communities go in muck around. Make a mess and move back out. \n\nWhat we do too is we advocate for communities. So if we go into community and we see maybe [00:04:00] that, the clinics aren't run efficient, there's no work staff. Because at the moment there's critical shortage of Aboriginal people working in clinics.\n\nSo we advocate for change. We'll go and we'll talk to, parliament. We'll talk to government, we'll talk to state reps. We've got a state rep in here today, minister. That will watch the film and certainly people will be talking to her about the trek and what needs to happen in communities. We educate, a beautiful example.\n\nYesterday we had three beautiful young girls and they're coming to me and they're talking, oh what do you do? And I said, I'm a nurse, but I'm. Doing my PhD, I'm at university and they said, we wanna study. We are gonna go back to boarding school so we can go. And I said, what do you wanna do? And they said, I wanna be a nurse or I wanna be a doctor.\n\nSo when we are out in community, we actually role models. So one part of it, they see us that they can do it. The other part is that, we [00:05:00] advocate. And by education is knowledge. So when people are educated about their illnesses and what causes rheumatic heart disease, they wanna make a difference.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not joining the trek this week, and it's always heartbreaking when, you've built up such a strong rapport with a group of people. Sometimes going into difficult communities, so it's more trekking more around Catherine.\n\nSo a lot around this Catherine area. There's a lot of schools here, big mob of Aboriginal people up here. So they'll be doing more scanning, more education in the classrooms to the kids and building our model of care as we go along. \n\nWe will do a quality assurance. So it's continually quality improvement. Continuous quality improvement, where we will get stronger each time we go on a trek because we know. What needs to improve. \n\nI think that, acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease rates aren't improving [00:06:00] as we, we want them to. So. there could be questionable little bit of improvement in the last A IHW. So that's the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Report.\n\nBut we are not on track to eliminate rheumatic heart disease by 2031. And we've signed up to it. Australia signed up at the World Health Assembly in 2018 to eliminate rheumatic heart disease in Australia by 2031. We cannot be complacent now. Now is the time to ramp up efforts and we need funding.\n\nAnd the funding needs to go directly to community. So community leadership, community ownership, our mob is smart. We got a lot of real deadly people out there in communities that know what the community want and how they can get the resources from that community to make a difference.\n\n",

          "transcript_content": "Georgina Byron\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nHere we are in Catherine, with the Deadly Heart team and also the goods project team.\n\nThe Deadly Heart team is a multidisciplinary team of medical experts and cultural guides, here to work together with community to stop this disease that is devastating community. And we've just been visiting a gorgeous family just here and they invited us in and just had a beautiful moment, where the goods project Nick and Ben, and together with the family built, a bed and it's a basket bed and it's got, \n\nTwo deckers of baskets and then a, foam top that can be washed. It's really going to be hygienic, but just seeing that family jump on that bed and do it together and, have a bit of a laugh and just felt really, you know, welcoming and warm. So that was really special. And tomorrow is the day when we start going to visit, schools with the deadly heart tech team and we are being invited into schools to educate and treat and [00:01:00] diagnose, rheumatic heart disease.\n\n'cause having just been to that family here, you've got. in the family rheumatic heart disease, is a part of their every day. they are so excited and understand that this disease is, making the families sick and they would love, greater education within the community, and they want people to be diagnosed early if they have it, so that they can then be treated, get on their penicillin injections, which is something they need to do for up to a decade. Us non-indigenous people, we don't have to face that. It's very rare that any of us get rheumatic heart disease because we've got access to a medical system on our doorstep.\n\nSo it rarely exists. Aboriginal communities don't have that, health equity, and they don't have that advantage to access medical experts.\n\nI think what's important about this deadly Heart Trek preventing and stopping rheumatic heart disease is the core principle.\n\nIt a culturally safe program? And that we have rheumatic heart disease [00:02:00] champions and we ensure that, we have a cultural briefing today we had. Beautiful briefing by one of the elders, may and Catherine, and she talked about two-way learning, and understanding. And so that, this trek is absolutely driven by culture, and community.\n\nSo that is the central pieces of this for the whole team and the whole team this morning learned a lot and we constantly learn and iterate, the trek, but at the same time It's led by community, ensured that it's culturally safe, and then you have access, the community has access to those medical experts.\n\nFundamentally, it's learning to live and understand each other's worlds. there are really two worlds. there's a world that is aboriginal and a world that is non-Aboriginal and we need to make a great effort.\n\nMay was talking about the load, that she has to have with constantly informing, white people aboriginal ways. It is very, very different and we have a responsibility to understand [00:03:00] that and, learn and adapt.\n\nI'd love to see these communities thriving no sickness, happy, healthy country, and a happy, healthy community. And being educated. Strong health and those bones of the community that is very culturally strong, that they're actually really healthy and well educated.\n\nThey can, achieve what they need to achieve, which is really being healthy and happy and educated and with jobs and a great bright future which they deserve. \n\nI think we all have a responsibility to understand each other's worlds, but the big decision makers for investment and action is really government.\n\nSo they need to listen and I also think that the public need to listen and have empathy. 'cause politicians only move when their community ask that and the listening doesn't happen with just Aboriginal communities. It is all of our communities that need to say, well, let's work together and get a healthy country and have healthy communities.\n\nThe stats [00:04:00] speaks themself it's two young people and it's, two thirds are female that die every week.\n\nTwo young Aboriginal people die almost every week when you look across all the statistics but it's actually the stories and what does that mean? In families, what does that mean in communities and how do they take care of each other? So that's the stories that Snow Foundation wants to get out there.\n\nIt's been a big weekend of not just, engaging with community, but also setting up so that we are a really strong force and we are doing it in a culturally safe way, and that we're gonna educate diagnose, treat rheumatic heart disease and ensure these families, are healthier.",
